[Looking for a compiled version?](https://github.com/stshrewsburyDev/Mumbo-clock/releases "Mumbo clock compiled releases")

[Looking for the rainmeter version? (better performance and visuals)](https://github.com/stshrewsburyDev/Mumbo-clock-rainmeter/releases/ "Mumbo clock rainmeter releases")

After almost 3 years of the original Mumbo clock release made in Python, I finally decided to make the original source code public. The clock is made using [PyGame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame "PyGame github repo") for the main clock and [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/ "PyQt5 PyPi project page") for the config.

## Python version compatiability:

This project was made back in 2019 and it shows. I have tried running this code in Python 3.9 and 3.10 but the requirements do not properly install, installing newer versions of the required libraries do allow some of the code to function but with some feature breakages, this is most likely fixable but I have not looked into it.

The version this was originally made for was **Python 3.6.8**. This project has been tested and still works on this version with no known issues.

## Disclaimer:

I am well aware that the code for this project is bad, there are many flaws, bugs, potentially even security issues for all I know. This is one of the main reasons why I discontinued this project and started work on the Rainmeter edition. The other reason was Rainmeter is designed for desktop widgets and is properly optimised for that where PyGame is a game engine and isnt properly opimised for this at all. Im still surprised to this day that I properly managed to get this to even work in the first place.
If you for some reason want to try working on this mess of a project then by all means have at it.
